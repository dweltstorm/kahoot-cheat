## How to use
When you visit [kahoot.it](https://kahoot.it/) to join a kahoot, you will be prompted to enter the kahoot name.
This doesn't have to be exact, but try to be as precise as possible.

Once you've entered the kahoot name, click OK and wait for the game to start.
Once in a kahoot, you can press CTRL + ALT + E to show the correct answer. 
The correct answer will be highlighted in green, while the others will be black.
